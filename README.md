# Georgia and Maxwell's Wedding website
My two friends were recently engaged and are looking to have a paperless wedding. They asked for my help in creating a wedding website that would not only provide detailed information about the wedding but also provide an RSVP service to eliminate the need for guests to respond via snail mail.

## Technologies Used
### Angualer JS
  * Also made use of the 'duScroll' module to enable smooth scrolling between anchors
### Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL
  * RSVP responses are stored in a database by unique email address
  * The site is set up with pre-canned users, authorizing only guests and admins to submit RSVPs and make RSVP updates 
### CSS/Sketch:
  * All of the star and constellation graphics were created in Sketch

## Approach
### Research: 
At the moment, Georgia and Maxwell have not decided on a venue, bridal parties, where to take engagement photos, etc. so the site currently serves as a template for them (and others) who would like to go paperless for their special day. That being said, I researched several wedding template websites (i.e. [eWedding](https://www.ewedding.com/10-real-couples-wedding-websites-get-inspired-now/), [WeddingWoo](http://www.weddingwoo.com/examples), etc.) to figure out what sort of information people typically provide for their wedding. I also searched for different RSVP card layouts in order to create a similar virtual card.

### Wireframes: 
I typically use a program to crate wireframes but this time I resorted to pen and paper. Sometimes it's faster for me to make changes this way, but things can get a little messy ...

## Future Enhancements
I will definitely be making future enhancements to the site, seeing as I'm largely using fake data right now that does not fully represent Georgia,  Maxwell, or the plans for their wedding (minus the color scheme and theme, they wanted stars/constellations and navy/rose gold). Aside from the actual wedding specifics, I'd like to do the following:

### Include an image gallery: 
The couple hasn't provided me with any engagement photos yet, but I still need to create a page or modal that will allow them to show these these off

### Add export capabilities: 
Currently the RSVP list is something that the admin can view on-screen only. I feel like if I were planning a wedding I'd want some sort of physical list to mark up as I'm planning things out. I'd like to include some sort of export to print or Excel feature on these lists to allow for this.

### Performance enhancements: 
I'm not sure why, but when scrolling through the site, the screen tends to freeze up or take a little longer to get to a specific section. I'd like to research why this is happening and make improvements accordingly.

### HTML/CSS cleanup
